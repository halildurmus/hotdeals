### Installation

1. Clone the repo using: `git clone https://github.com/halildurmus/hotdeals.git`
2. Register the app on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).
3. To register your app with Firebase, follow the instructions in [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android)
4. If you want to support Facebook Login, follow the instructions in [here](https://facebook.meedu.app/docs/4.x.x/android).
